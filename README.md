- Then I wrote the HTML
- Second, how can i use CSS to achieve the layout
- Then I wrote the CSS for layout
- Third, how should each element be styled
- Then I wrote CSS for each element
- Finally I refactored the css

</div>
```

```css
#bg-circle {
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 26px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 126px;
    background: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
